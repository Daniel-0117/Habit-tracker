## Description
This project was created so that users will have the backend for a habit tracker app. It performs many of the functions needed for a habit tracker app such as creating, deleting, and getting a user along with their habits. 

## Usage
To use this application the user must clone the repo. Then once properly cloned the user has to perform pip i into the integrated terminal, once all the modules have been properly installed the application is ready to be used. To test this without a front end use a program such as Insomnia to test the various endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN a RESTful API

THEN I receive a list of all habits I have created, sorted alphabetically.

WHEN I send a PATCH request to update a habit,
THEN the habitâ€™s name is updated in my personal list.

WHEN I send a DELETE request for a habit,
THEN the habit is removed from my personal list.

WHEN I send a GET request for my user info,
THEN I receive my account details (email, ID, and habits).

WHEN I send a DELETE request for my user account,
THEN my account and all related habits are deleted from the system.
